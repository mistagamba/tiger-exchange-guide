        <h1>Tiger Exchange: Getting Your ID and First Steps</h1>
        <p>Tiger Exchange has been growing fast, and we think the "AI" branding they've been pushing has something to do with it. Whether the AI actually does anything meaningful is debatable, but the platform itself is solid.</p>

<h2>What's the Deal with Tiger Exchange</h2>
<p>At its core, Tiger Exchange is a cricket and sports exchange platform. The odds are competitive, the interface works well on mobile, and they've built up a decent reputation for fast payouts. We've tested withdrawals multiple times and the average was about 30 minutes.</p>

<p>The "TigerExch AI" feature claims to offer smart betting suggestions. Take that with a grain of salt. But the underlying platform? Legit. Good market depth, reliable uptime, responsive support.</p>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>Standard WhatsApp-based signup. Deposit via UPI, get your ID, start betting. They have dedicated support for new users which is a nice touch.</p>

<p>Check out <a href="https://tigerexchid.com/">Tiger Exchange</a> for the full rundown. If you want to go straight to getting an ID, the <a href="https://tigerexchid.com/tiger-exchange-id/">Tiger Exchange ID</a> page has what you need. There's also info about the <a href="https://tigerexchid.com/tiger-exchange-app/">Tiger Exchange App</a> if you prefer the mobile experience, and <a href="https://tigerexchid.com/tiger-exchange-betting/">Tiger Exchange Betting</a> for details on available markets.</p>

<p>Honestly, Tiger Exchange is a good option if you want something that's actively being developed and updated. Some platforms feel stuck in 2022. This one doesn't.</p>
